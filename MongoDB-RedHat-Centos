Install MongoDB Community Edition on Red Hat Enterprise or CentOS Linux

https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-red-hat/

Using .rpm Packages  

1. Configure the package management system (yum).

Create a /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-4.2.repo file to install MongoDB directly using yum:

[mongodb-org-4.2]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/$releasever/mongodb-org/4.2/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.2.asc

2.Install the MongoDB packages.

To install the latest stable version of MongoDB
sudo yum install -y mongodb-org

The yum upgrades the packages when a newer version becomes available. To prevent unintended upgrades, pin the package. To pin a package, add the following exclude directive to your /etc/yum.conf file:

 exclude=mongodb-org,mongodb-org-server,mongodb-org-shell,mongodb-org-mongos,mongodb-org-tools

******************************************************************
  Run MongoDB Community Edition


MongoDB provides officially supported packages in their own repository:
Package Name 	 Description
mongodb-org 	: A metapackage that will automatically install the four component packages listed below.

mongodb-org-server 	: Contains the mongod daemon, associated init script, and a configuration file (/etc/mongod.conf). You can use the initialization script to start mongod with the configuration file.  

mongodb-org-mongos 	: Contains the mongos daemon.
mongodb-org-shell 	: Contains the mongo shell.
mongodb-org-tools 	: Contains the following MongoDB tools: mongoimport bsondump, mongodump, mongoexport, mongofiles, mongorestore, mongostat, and mongotop.


By default, MongoDB runs using the mongod user account and uses the following default directories:

    /var/lib/mongo (the data directory)
    /var/log/mongodb (the log directory)

âž¤ If installed via the package manager,
    The default directories are created, and the owner and group for these directories are set to mongod.

  To Start MongoDB

  >sudo service mongod start

  Verify that MongoDB has started successfully

  To verify that the mongod process has started successfully by checking the contents of the log file at /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log for a line reading

  [initandlisten] waiting for connections on port <port>
 
where <port> is the port configured in /etc/mongod.conf, 27017 by default.

You can optionally ensure that MongoDB will start following a system reboot by issuing the following command:

  >sudo chkconfig mongod on

   To Stop MongoDB

   sudo service mongod stop

 Restart MongoDB.
 >sudo service mongod restart

  You can follow the state of the process for errors or important messages by watching the output in the /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log file.
  Begin using MongoDB.

Start a mongo shell on the same host machine as the mongod. You can run the mongo shell without any command-line options to connect to a mongod that is running on your localhost with default port 27017:
  > mongo

to connect to a MongoDB instance running on localhost with a non-default port 28015:
  mongo --port 28015

To connect to a MongoDB instance running on a remote host machine:
mongo "mongodb://mongodb0.example.com:28015"

 To use the command-line option --host <host>:<port>. For example, to connect to a MongoDB instance running on a remote host machine:

  mongo --host mongodb0.example.com:28015
  mongo --host mongodb0.example.com --port 28015

 Working with the mongo Shell

To display the database you are using, type db:
 >db
The operation should return 'test', which is the default database.

To switch databases, issue the use <db> helper, as in the following example:

 >use <database>

To list the databases available to the user, use the helper 'show dbs'
